            Land Cover Detection using Aerial Imagery
          </h3>

          <br>

          <p>
            In today's digital age, the volume of image data is growing rapidly, thanks to the widespread availability of camera equipment. Teaching computers to identify objects within images holds immense potential in various fields, from healthcare to surveillance. However, automated object detection remains a challenging task for researchers.
            <br><br>
            This project focuses on land cover detection using aerial imagery, a crucial application in remote sensing. The goal was to develop machine learning algorithms to classify images into different land cover categories. The dataset used in this project originates from the UC Merced Land Use dataset, derived from large-scale urban area imagery (Yang & Newsam, 2010). The dataset comprises 2100 RGB images, available in two resolutions, along with corresponding labels. To classify these images, an analysis approach of implementing two classification methods for the 21 classes and comparing them was chosen. A support vector machine was implemented as well as a convolutional neural network. Accuracies of 60.95% and 81.90% were achieved by the SVM and CNN respectively. While the CNN produce a very good result, the SVM model performed significantly poorer to models that have been trained in other work (Cao et al., 2019; Ya≈üar & Utku, 2023).

            The report outlines the approach, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection, and evaluation. The experimental results are presented, including performance metrics and visualizations, and potential areas for improvement are discussed. The code that was written to produce the results can be seen in the Jupyter notebook.
